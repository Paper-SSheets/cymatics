# cymatics
Yea, so there's a few things that led up to me wanting to do this, and I want to collect links for it soon. Essentially, I want software for displaying cymatics, given certain audio or audio files, on objects of varying density, shape, thickness, with different mediums of display, from the conventional sand and water to who knows. I also want to explore 3D representations of these sounds waves, but that seems, initially in my mind, far more complex. I was listening to a reading of The Emerald Tablets of Thoth and there's specific words that are to be said in a ritualistic manner, and that got me curious as to the thought of the language of the mind, a universal language, and the general idea across history of certain "words of power", or spells, or whatever. I am curious to see the shapes and, wishfully thinking, models of these words and maybe have my curiosity sated.
